Purpose :
Using data obtained from Chicago Data Portal, we analyzed the data from the Chicago Benchmarking program. This program was adopted in 2013 in order to raise awarness and improve energy use in the city. This ordinace, from 2016, requires building over 50,000sqft to report energy usage. Using the data from csv(approx. 25,000), we analyzed the data and created visuals with different libraries Matoplotlib, Seaborn, Tabulate, React and Chackra UI. The visualization did demonstate on overall downward trend in energy consumption in all different building types.

Instructions:
To interact with the Javascript visualization, website will be opened with html and opening with live server. The energy usage of buldings in Chicago can be filtered through years.
For the table visualization, download the files, on commandline/ gitbash npm start...

Ethical Considerations:
Ethical considerations taken on this project is the fairness and being mindful of potential biases, if the data is coming from specific neighborhoods and not repersenting the city of Chicago as a whole. With the data being primarily focused on buildings of a larger size, the neighboorhoods that make the most improvement would be the ones who have the largest number of buildings.  Also privacy is important for in each row the address of the building is shown and can lead to the name of the owners to be easily found. 



In order to make chart I used code from Stackover Flow (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51046983/show-the-value-on-the-each-color-of-stacked-bar-chart-from-a-different-column-of)
